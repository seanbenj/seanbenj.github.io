# My Portfolio Website
I am married to a wonderful wife, father of 3 great daughters. 
Love the outdoors, art, music, writing, food. 
Now pursuing becoming a programmer. 
it's really fun fine tuning your thinking until you can make code 
work in a specific way, to add features and create something.
I know that I have a lot to learn and will continue to have plenty
to learn as I move into a JR programming role, I look forward to it!

I created my website using HTML/CSS, feel free to carouse it!

### Here are some project highlights:

* [Pizza ordering menu webpage](https://github.com/seanbenj/Basic-tech-aca/tree/master/ChallengesReWork/PizzaProjectJS)<br>
This challenge was a fun project where I created a pizza menu showing totals and each item ordered via HTML/CSS/Javascript.

* [Game O' War](https://github.com/seanbenj/Basic-tech-aca/blob/master/LIBRARY2017.txt)<br>
I really enjoyed making this card game, creating the classes, methods, getting everything to flow in C# ASP.NET Webforms.

* [Library Database](https://github.com/seanbenj/Basic-tech-aca/blob/master/LIBRARY2017.txt)<br>
Made a library database based on a set of challenge requirments using SQL and MS SQL SERVER 2014, this was a great time,
looking over the relationships I needed and figuring out how to connect the tables together.

Feel free to contact me!
