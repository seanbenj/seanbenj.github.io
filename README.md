My Portfolio Website
---
I am married to a wonderful wife, father of 3 great daughters. 
Love the outdoors, art, music, writing, food. 
Now pursuing becoming a programmer. 
it's really fun fine tuning your thinking until you can make code 
work in a specific way, to add features and create something.
I know that I have a lot to learn and will continue to have plenty
to learn as I move into a JR programming role, I look forward to it!

I created my website using HTML/CSS, enjoy!

Feel free to contact me!
